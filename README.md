# eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect

ESLint rule to warn against [unnecessary React `useEffect`s](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) to make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone. Highly recommended for new React developers as you learn its mental model, and even experienced developers may be surprised.

## ðŸš€ Installation

This plugin requires ESLint v7.0.0 or later.

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect
```

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Add the plugin to your ESLint configuration file:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect"],
  "rules": {
    "eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect/you-might-not-need-an-effect": "warn"
  }
}
```

This plugin assumes that your effects receive correct dependencies. Thus the [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)`/exhaustive-deps` rule is also recommended.

## ðŸ”Ž Rule: `you-might-not-need-an-effect`

Warns when an effect is likely unnecessary, such as when it:

- Only uses internal state or props
- Derives or chains state updates
- Initializes state
- Resets all state when props change
- Passes data to the parent component

It does not detect when an effect:

- Uses state to handle events

Some cases are complex and nuanced, and difficult to reliably detect. This plugin attempts to minimize false positives and accepts inevitable false negatives. But please open an issue if you experience either.
